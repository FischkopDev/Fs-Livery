<h1>FS 2020 Livery Manager</h1>
This tool will help to install livery's and special aircraft paintings in the new flight simulator.
Just start and select the downloaded livery's. The program will copy it into the community folder of 
the simulator.

This program is open src and free to use. If anything isn't working properly, just contact me and I will
fix this issue.
